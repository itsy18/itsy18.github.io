Welcome to my homepage! I am a first year computer engineering at the University of Cal State Fullerton. I have my first two years of college done due to the fact that I have completed my general education requirements in highschool. I hope to graduate by 2026!

### My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 2

    - This was the lab where we used Blackjack in our code. My partner was Bawanpreet Aujla. This was my favorite lab because I was able to learn how to play blackjack for the first time. Being able to learn the basics of blackjack and creating a coded game for a user to play was so cool to me. In this part of the lab, we were introduced to bools and were required to use them in our code. It was quite a challenge. I remember struggling a lot with how to properly format them and when exactly to use them.
 
* Lab 4, part 2

    - This was my second favorite lab because in part 2 we could code and play a high/low guessing game. My partner was Kevin Sotelo. What I learned in this lab was how to print and store different phrases in the code so that the computer would know what to say depending on how the person playing is answering. It was amazing that I was able to compute something where I can make a player guess a number and the program will tell them if they are too high, too low, or correct. This was also a lab where we could practice our if statements. It was a bit of a challenge to use the if statements, but with enough practice, I was able to pass the lab.

* Lab 7

    - This was my third favorite lab because it was like solving a puzzle to me in a way. My partner was Elias Zoreikat. Having to look at the pictures provided to be able to know when someone can park in a designated area or not was fun for me in a way. It wasnâ€™t difficult to figure out. While doing this lab, one of the areas I kept running into was that a few of my tests were not passing. It did take a while to thoroughly look back in my code to figure out why my test was not passing. I was able to figure it out, but I probably made a small mistake due to the fact there were many rules about when a car could park in a designated area or not.
